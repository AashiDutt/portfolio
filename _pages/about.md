I am currently working at [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My projects span across a wide variety of topics including model optimization, generative modeling, CRNN architectures, and so on.

Previously at [DataCamp](https://datacamp.pxf.io/Ry0EG9), I developed projects ([Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://datacamp.pxf.io/doyrOM) and [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://datacamp.pxf.io/MXKEAJ)), and practice pools ([Advanced Deep Learning with Keras](https://datacamp.pxf.io/7mXKaA)). Prior to DataCamp, I worked at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (TRDDC) on **Data Privacy**. There, I was a part of the cybersecurity research team working on TCS's critically acclaimed GDPR solution called [Crystal Ball](https://www.tcs.com/tcs-recognized-leader-gdpr-services-by-nelsonhall).

My subject of interest broadly lies in the area of _visual representation learning_. I love open-source initiatives and currently, I am actively contributing to <a href="https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul"><font color="#FF6F00">TensorFlow Hub</font></a> and <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras Examples</font></a>. Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied Machine Learning ideas, and giving talks at developer meetups and conferences.
