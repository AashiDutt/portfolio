Hi there. Thank you for visiting this site. I am Sayak (à¦¸à¦¾à§Ÿà¦•). I am currently with [PyImageSearch](pyimagesearch.com) where I apply deep learning to solve real-world problems in computer vision and bring some of the solutions to edge devices. I am also responsible for providing Q&A support to PyImageSearch readers.

Previously at [DataCamp](datacamp.com), I developed projects ([here](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd) and [here](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/754?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd)), and practice pools ([here](https://practice.datacamp.com/p/217?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd)) for DataCamp. Prior to DataCamp, I have worked at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (TRDDC) on **Data Privacy**. There, I was a part of TCS's critically acclaimed GDPR solution called [Crystal Ball](https://www.tcs.com/tcs-recognized-leader-gdpr-services-by-nelsonhall).

Off the work, I enjoy [writing technical articles](https://sayakpaul.github.io/portfolio/authoring/) and [talking at developer meetups and conferences](https://sayakpaul.github.io/portfolio/talksseminarsworkshops/). My subject of interest broadly lies in areas like **Machine Learning Interpretability**, **Full-Stack Data Science**.
