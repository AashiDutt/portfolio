I am generally interested in the area of representation learning. More specifically, I am interested in the following areas: semi-supervision, self-supervision, and model robustness. At [Carted](https://www.carted.com/), I am currently working on representation learning from raw HTML web pages as well as various use-cases around NLP.

 I enjoy implementing research ideas, sometimes incorporating them in practical applications, and communicating my implementation details through [articles](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). I advocate for highly readable and self-contained code. I primarily use Python for programming. I am proficient in TensorFlow and a beginner in PyTorch. 

I have a flair for open-source initiatives. In particular, I have made contributions to <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras</font></a>, [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/commits?author=sayakpaul), [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commits?author=sayakpaul), <a href="https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul"><font color="#FF6F00">TensorFlow Hub</font></a>, <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/commits?author=sayakpaul"><font color="#d00000">Keras Examples</font></a>, [TensorFlow Addons](https://git.io/JuUOr), and [Neural Structured Learning](https://git.io/JuUOd). Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied Machine Learning ideas, and giving talks at developer meetups and conferences.

For my community contributions and innovative projects, the Intel Software Innovator Program recognized me as one of [their top innovators in 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzsy1q8jgkwj6cj/Intel_Top_Innovator_2019.jpg?dl=0). For my open-source contributions, I received the Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in [2020](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html), [2021](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/09/announcing-latest-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html), and [2022](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2022/09/announcing-the-second-group-of-open-source-peer-bonus-winners-in-2022.html), and [TensorFlow Top Contributor Award](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/11/2021-TF-Contributor-Awardees.html?linkId=8010214) in 2021. A detailed account of the awards and recognitions is available [here](https://sayak.dev/xyz/#awards-and-recognition).
