I am currently working at [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/) on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My projects span across a wide variety of topics including model optimization, generative modeling, CRNN architectures, and so on.

Previously at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), I developed projects ([Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd) and [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/754?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd)), and practice pools ([Advanced Deep Learning with Keras](https://practice.datacamp.com/p/217?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=357540-5b28dd) (requires a login to see)). Prior to DataCamp, I worked at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (TRDDC) on **Data Privacy**. There, I was a part of the cybersecurity research team working on TCS's critically acclaimed GDPR solution called [Crystal Ball](https://www.tcs.com/tcs-recognized-leader-gdpr-services-by-nelsonhall).

My subject of interest broadly lies in the area of visual representation learning. I love open-source initiatives and currently, I am actively contributing to [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul). Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied Machine Learning ideas, and giving talks at developer meetups and conferences.
