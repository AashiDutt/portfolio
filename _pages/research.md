I am interested in a number of topics pertaining to Deep Learning:

* Self-supervised and semi-supervised representation learning
* Model robustness
* Model optimization

Please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ecW-EE4AAAAJ&hl=en#) for details
on the publications I have been a part of.
