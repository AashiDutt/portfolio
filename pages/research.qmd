I am interested in the area of representation learning. More recently, I have developed an interest in diffusion models. 

Please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ecW-EE4AAAAJ&hl=en#) for details
on the publications I have been a part of. 

### Tutorials

- [Practical Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning: Problems and Solutions](https://sites.google.com/view/par-2021) (CVPR'21)
- [Foundational Robustness of Foundation Models](https://sites.google.com/view/neurips2022-frfm-turotial/) (NeurIPS'22)
- [All Things ViTs: Understanding and Interpreting Attention in Vision](https://all-things-vits.github.io/atv/) (CVPR'23)

### Invited talks, demos, etc.

- Controlling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: Assorted Approaches, [BigMAC ICCV Workshop](https://bigmac-vision.github.io/) in 2023, UCL and Texas A&M University in 2024.

### Teaching assistance

Served as a TA for [Full Stack Deep Learningâ€™s 2022 cohort](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/#teaching-assistants).

### Reviewing

TMLR, ICLR'25, NeurIPS'24, AAAI'23, [UDL workshop (ICML'21)](https://sites.google.com/view/udlworkshop2021/home), [ICASSP'21](https://www.2021.ieeeicassp.org/) (sub-reviewer), [Artificial Intelligence (Elsevier)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence), [IEEE Access](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/).

### Misc
