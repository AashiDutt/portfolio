My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

# News
- Our Manning liveProject (with [Souradip Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souradip-chakraborty/)) [Summarize News Articles with NLP, Deep Learning, and Python](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/summarize-news-articles-with-nlp-deep-learning-and-python?a_aid=pyimagesearch&a_bid=643ce05e) is now available as a MEAP. The code **lpsumnlp20** is always good for a 35% discount on the liveProject.
- Worked on a minimal implementation of SimSiam ([Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566) by Xinlei Chen & Kaiming He) in TensorFlow 2 - [https://github.com/sayakpaul/SimSiam-TF](https://github.com/sayakpaul/SimSiam-TF). 
- Collaborated on a multi-part tutorial series on **Create Artistic Effect by Stylizing Image Background** (joint work with ML-GDE [Margaret Maynard-Reid](https://twitter.com/margaretmz) and [George Soloupis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-soloupis/)) - [Part I](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/image-background-stylizer-part-1-project-intro-d68c4547e7e3), [Part II](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/create-artistic-effect-by-stylizing-image-background-part-2-tensorflow-lite-models-e614af91944d), [Part III](https://farmaker47.medium.com/android-part-of-create-artistic-effect-by-stylizing-an-image-segment-2a646da2d39a).
- Worked on [TensorFlow Lite variants](https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/lite-model/mirnet-fixed/dr/1) of the MiRNet model that is capable of enhancing low-light images greatly. The project repository is available [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/MIRNet-TFLite).  
- Spoke with **Simon Kornblith** (Google Brain) at the [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://youtu.be/1EqJyMy0LnE) (with Tim Scarfe and Yannic Kilcher).
