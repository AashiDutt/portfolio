I am Sayak (সায়ক) Paul. This is my personal website and it includes my blog posts, coordinates, interviews, and stuff like that. Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

# News
- New blog post: [MixUp augmentation for image classification](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mixup/).
- Worked on a minimal implementation of **SimSiam** (Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning by Xinlei Chen & Kaiming He) in TensorFlow 2 - [https://github.com/sayakpaul/SimSiam-TF](https://github.com/sayakpaul/SimSiam-TF). 
- Open-sourced my implementation of **Sharpness-Aware Minimization** (SAM) [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Sharpness-Aware-Minimization-TensorFlow). SAM is proposed in [Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Sharpness-Aware-Minimization-TensorFlow).
- Open-sourced my experiments on **Adaptive Gradient Clipping** (AGC) [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/Adaptive-Gradient-Clipping). AGC is proposed in [High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06171).
- Our (with [Pin-Yu Chen](http://www.pinyuchen.com/) and [Dipanjan Sarkar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dipanzan)) tutorial on **Practical Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning: Problems and Solutions** has been accepted for [CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/). Details are available on [this website](https://sites.google.com/view/par-2021).
