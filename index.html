Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am Sayak (à¦¸à¦¾à§Ÿà¦•) Paul. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Carted](https://www.carted.com/). Know more about me
from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for
Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks
from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

# News

- New work with [Pin-Yu Chen](http://www.pinyuchen.com/) (IBM Research): [Vision Transformers are Robust Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07581). Accepted
  to AAAI 2022.
- New work with [Siddha Ganju](https://sidgan.github.io/siddhaganju) (NVIDIA): [Flood Segmentation on Sentinel-1 SAR
  Imagery with Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08369). This work is based on our winning solution
  ([first runners-up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4JTAYChV6PHwDA87gd2FJ04843YA6bN/view?usp=sharing)) submitted to
  [this competition](https://nasa-impact.github.io/etci2021/) organized by the NASA Impact team. We also
  made it to four NeurIPS 2021 workshops: [_AI for Science: Mind the Gaps_](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/),
  [_Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning_](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2021), [_Women
  in ML_](https://wimlworkshop.org/sh_events/wiml-neurips2021/), and [_Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences_](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/).
- New project: implementation of [DeiT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877). Includes pre-trained models, code for inference,
  fine-tuning, attention rollout visualization, etc. Check out the project [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/deit-tf).
- New project with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](https://twitter.com/arig23498) on probing the representations learned by ViTs. Code,
  models, tutorial, interactive demos, visuals are available [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/probing-vits).
- [Contributed](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/16255) TensorFlow variant of Masked Autoencoders to ðŸ¤— Transformers
  with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](https://twitter.com/arig23498). Model documentation is available
  [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/vit_mae). 

To know about my projects, please refer to [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/sayakpaul). 

Apart from the following blog posts, I try to contribute to other platforms in the form of writing. Please refer [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/)
for more details.
