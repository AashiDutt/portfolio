- New work with [Pin-Yu Chen](http://www.pinyuchen.com/) (IBM Research): [Vision Transformers are Robust Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07581).
- New work with [Siddha Ganju](https://sidgan.github.io/siddhaganju) (NVIDIA): [Flood Segmentation on Sentinel-1 SAR
  Imagery with Semi-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08369). This work is based on our winning solution
  ([first runners-up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U4JTAYChV6PHwDA87gd2FJ04843YA6bN/view?usp=sharing)) submitted to
  [this competition](https://nasa-impact.github.io/etci2021/) organized by the NASA Impact team.
- Ported JAX model weights of Vision Transformer and MLP-Mixer models to TensorFlow. Details are 
  available [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/ViT-jax2tf) and [here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/MLPMixer-jax2tf). The collections
  contain a total of 28 models. 
- [Graph regularization for image classification using synthesized graphs](https://git.io/Ju942) (in collaboration with the [NSL team
  at Google](https://www.tensorflow.org/neural_structured_learning))
- New post from the GCP blog: [Dual deployments on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/dual-deployments-vertex-ai) (joint
  work with [Chansung Park](https://github.com/deep-diver)).
