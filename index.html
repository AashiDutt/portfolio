I am Sayak (সায়ক) Paul. This is my personal website and it includes my blog posts, coordinates, interviews, and stuff like that. Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

- My talk **Demystifying Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Recognition** got selected for [SciPy Japan 2020](https://www.scipyjapan.scipy.org/schedule). [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I08Gojs0d5x8TpW6sjsEb_aMXmCVwfMGr_zscYqhB6E/edit?usp=sharing) a brief outline of what I am going to be presenting.
- Our paper (collaboration with Aritra Roy Gosthipaty and Souradip Chakraborty) **G-SimCLR: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning with Guided Projection via Pseudo Labelling** got accepted at [ICDM 2020](http://icdm2020.bigke.org/) for the [Deep Learning for Knowledge Transfer (DLKT)](https://fuzhenzhuang.github.io/DLKT2020/index.html) workshop. The code is available [here](https://github.com/ariG23498/G-SimCLR). The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12007). 
- New blog post [**Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning with SwAV**](https://app.wandb.ai/authors/swav-tf/reports/Unsupervised-Visual-Representation-Learning-with-SwAV--VmlldzoyMjg3Mzg). This is a joint work with [Ayush](https://twitter.com/ayushthakur0).
