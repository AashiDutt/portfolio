I am Sayak (সায়ক) Paul. This is my personal website and it includes my blog posts, coordinates, interviews, and stuff like that. Know more about me from [here](https://sayak.dev/about/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), an easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.

My external articles and other publishing engagements (like books, liveProjects, etc.) are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/authoring/). Decks from my speaking engagements are listed [here](https://sayak.dev/talksseminarsworkshops/). Interviews are [here](https://sayak.dev/interviews/).

# News
- Our Manning liveProject (with [Souradip Chakraborty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souradip-chakraborty/)) [Summarize News Articles with NLP, Deep Learning, and Python](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/summarize-news-articles-with-nlp-deep-learning-and-python?a_aid=pyimagesearch&a_bid=643ce05e) is now available as a MEAP.
- Spoke on **Demystifying Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Recognition** at [SciPy Japan 2020](https://www.scipyjapan.scipy.org/schedule). Deck is available here - [bit.ly/scipy-sp](http://bit.ly/scipy-sp).
- Our paper (collaboration with [Aritra Roy Gosthipaty](http://arig23498.github.io/) and Souradip Chakraborty) **G-SimCLR: Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning with Guided Projection via Pseudo Labelling** got accepted at [ICDM 2020](http://icdm2020.bigke.org/) for the [Deep Learning for Knowledge Transfer (DLKT)](https://fuzhenzhuang.github.io/DLKT2020/index.html) workshop. The code is available [here](https://github.com/ariG23498/G-SimCLR). The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12007). 
- Received the [Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html).
